# Philosophers

Philosophers explores the dining philosophers problem, offering solutions using both threads and processes in C. This project provided an opportunity to delve into concurrent programming and synchronization techniques. By implementing solutions to prevent deadlock and starvation, I gained insights into thread and process management, mutexes, semaphores, and shared memory. Philosophers reflects my journey in understanding concurrent programming challenges and showcases my efforts in tackling synchronization issues in multi-threaded and multi-process environments.
